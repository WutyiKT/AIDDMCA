This is the Part-2 of Real-world Problem Formulation and Code Implementation.
Defining the problem, decision variables, objective function, and constraints.
Formulating the problem using Linear Programming and the solution is implemented using the PuLP with its default solver (COIN-OR Branch and Cut Solver).
The status of optimization and each production of optimal units are displayed as well as the total profit is also printed.
